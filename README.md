###IM Extra Fields### 
`GetSimple plugin based on ItemManager 2`

IM Extra Fields is a new plugin based on ItemManager 2.3.4 - ItemManager offers since version 2.3.4 new features, that simplify the usage the plugin in combination with GetSimple native pages. The IM-Extra-Fields plugin allows creation extra fields for native GS pages and is a kind of a mix between "I18N Custom Fields" and "Special Pages" plugins.

For instance, it allows you to create a bunch of categories with different fields and properties. These can then be selected by end-user within "page options" menu, depending upon need. Here is an example of how to extend a simple index page by ItemManager's file field:

The IM Extra Fields plugin has a very simple structure and should act more as an interface between ItemManager's and GetSimple's functionality. IM-Extra-Fields has scant functions of its own, does not stand alone and uses just the functionality of the ItemManager framework. 

A little restriction in the Beta version:

IM Extra Fields plugin does not support duplicates of the title, also not for items of the different categories. For example, when you create a new item within a "Test" category, let's say with a title "index". If you now edit your index page and assign it to a different category "ExtraPages" for example, than the "index" item of the "Test" category that you have created before will be deleted.
